One hardly knows what to make of backfence gossip so inelegantly crafted that its unintentional humor is as striking as what we're supposed to be hopping mad about.  The piece is worth a read if only for its <NOBR>""... the</NOBR> Secret Service which has statuary responsibility to protect the First Family"" line. (What, the Secret Service has to stand really, really still? Or are lantern-jawed agents charged with running about gardens to shoo away diarrheal pigeons?)

All humor aside, this is a blood-boiler, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.  It's gossip, plain and simple; a dirty little story dumped onto the Internet to further discredit a President and First Lady some don't like.

11072	Although influenza is no longer the unchecked grim reaper of years past (in 1918 it killed half a million Americans and twenty to forty million folks worldwide), it continues to present a very real danger even in these more modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), millions of people in the United States (about 10% to 20% of U.S. residents) will get the flu each year. Influenza also costs Americans $10 billion annually in lost wages and medical expenses. Worst of all, every year about 36,000 people in the United States die from it, and 114,000 have to be admitted to the hospital because of it. The flu is not just a week of feeling lousy and missing work; it is a disease that can and does kill.	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-onions-vs-flu/

11798	For those who place wagers on sporting events, correctly predicting which team will win a particular match generally isn’t sufficient — what the successful bettor really has to anticipate is whether or not the (relative) final score of a contest will fall within the point spread (also known as the “line”) established by the sports book outfits that broker the wagers. (That is, the sports gambler isn’t technically betting on whether Team A will beat Team B, but rather whether Team A will win the contest by at least a specified number of points.) Lines are based upon a number of factors (e.g., teams’ past performances, current player injuries, anticipated weather conditions) and are generally established to produce “two-way action” (i.e., balanced betting on both sides).	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/catherine-bells-astonishing-super-bowl-prediction/

Because so much of what we do at snopes.com involves staring at the written word day in and day out, we’ve pulled together a collection of online linguistic misfires we found particularly entertaining. (Hey, we spend our days staring at computer screens. It doesn’t take much to amuse us.) Some of these howlers were clearly instances of wrong words being chosen in place of similar-sounding right ones, but others were just as clearly the result of common phrases having been misheard by those who later tried to put them to use.	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/when-words-fail-us/

15437	“Do you know what the area code for Buffalo is?” begins a popular joke of the 1990s.  “Oh-for-four” (044) is the punchline response, a reference to the city’s NFL football team, which went down to defeat in four consecutive Super Bowls from 1991 to 1994.  The joke is sardonically funny, but it’s also an unfortunate reinforcement of the stigmatization of those who come up just short of first place in the highest levels of athletic competition as “failures.”  Sure, the Buffalo Bills have never won on Super Sunday and thereby established themselves as champions of the NFL, but that shortfall should not be allowed to obscure the Bills’ remarkable achievement: only an extraordinarily talented team could have reached the Super Bowl for four straight years, and nobody but the Bills has ever accomplished that feat.  (The Miami Dolphins managed three consecutive Super Bowl appearances in the early 1970s, losing the first and winning the next two.)	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hail-mary/

Almost every tradition we unthinkingly observe during the festive season has its roots in long-ago times, a fact we’re comfortably though vaguely aware of even though very few of us modern fellows have any idea of the whys of our symbols and rituals. We know to erect a Christmas tree, for instance, but we don’t know why we’re supposed to, other than it looks good in our living room and gives us a place to leave presents under. We know we’re supposed to kiss under mistletoe, but we don’t know why, and we harbor a vague sense of wanting to give something to carolers who come to our door, but offhand can’t think of any reason to other than ordinary hospitality.	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/christmas-superstitions/

State Capitol, Texas &mdash; Presidential candidate <NOBR>G.W. Bush</NOBR> prides himself on presiding over <NOBR>121 executions</NOBR> with perfect oversight. State representative Tim Moore wanted to show how careful the legislative process was in the state. He sponsored a bill praising Albert Salvo, a man whose ""unconventional techniques involving population control and applied psychology"" had already been noted by the state of Massachusetts. The Texas politicians, never wanting to be outdone by any state, unanimously passed a resolution praising Albert Salvo. Salvo is better known as The Boston Strangler.

Representative Tim Moore sponsored a resolution in the Texas House of Representatives in Austin, Texas calling on the House to commend Albert de Salvo for his unselfish service to ""his country, his state and his community.""  The resolution stated that ""this compassionate gentleman's dedication and devotion to his work has enabled the weak and the lonely throughout the nation to achieve and maintain a new degree of concern for their future. He has been officially recognized by the state of Massachusetts for his noted activities and unconventional techniques involving population control and applied psychology."" The resolution was passed unanimously. Representative Moore then revealed that he had only tabled the motion to show how the legislature passes bills and resolutions often without reading them or understanding what they say. Albert de Salvo was the Boston Strangler."	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-ayes-of-texas/

Or, as J. Richard Udry wrote, “[i]t is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasy that when people are trapped by some immobilizing event which deprives them of their usual activities, most will turn to copulation”:	false	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-baby-train/
